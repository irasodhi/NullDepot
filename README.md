# 🧪 NullDepot

**NullDepot** is a collaborative platform where scientists and researchers can **document failed experiments**, allowing others to learn from past mistakes and avoid repeating them — saving **time, money, and resources**.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

In traditional scientific publishing, **failed experiments are rarely shared**, even though they contain crucial insights.  
This leads to:
- Repetition of known failures  
- Waste of research funding  
- Loss of time and effort  
- Slower scientific progress  

---

## 💡 Solution

**NullDepot** acts as a public repository of failed experiments where:
- Researchers can **submit failed experiments**
- Others can **view, search, and analyze failures**
- The research community benefits from **transparency and shared learning**
